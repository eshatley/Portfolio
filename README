This repository was created to contain and diplay my personal coding portfolio.

I am an aspiring Technical Artist. I love all kinds of games but paticularly action RPG's (Diablo 3!!!) and games with interesting visual styles 
(Night in the Woods, Limbo, to name a few.). I want to help tell impactful, relatable human stories through the medium of video games. Video games
helped me survive some of the toughest times in my own life and I want to be a part of giving that to others. The first game I ever played was
Donkey Kong Country 64 with my older brother. He died when I was only 10 and I used games as a way to cope and try to stay connected to him. Later
in highschool when I was the kid with no friends and a broken home, games like Mass Effect gave me refuge and hope. They gave me the chance to see 
myself as someone worth while, the hero of my own story, and characters that I could relate to.

I've taken some programing classes with Midwestern University(C++) but for the most part I am self taught. I started learning Python in the early 
2000s because I wanted to be able to script for MUDs(Multi User Dungeons. The epitome of nerdom.) and later it became useful for my military training
as we spent a lot of time networking with Linux Redhat. Ubuntu is still my operating system of choice for everything except gaming. I used Mimo to 
learn the basics of Java Script, HTML and as an entry point/refresher for various other languages. I plan on building my own website to host both
my art and my code at some point in the not too distant future. 

I've made various personal projects in Unity, all though none of them are complete games as of yet. I made a demo level of a 2D adventure game where 
the player character is a man with telekinetic powers in a world where super heros are hated. I created a script that would allow the player to click
various objects in the game world and throw them around with realistic gravity and weight. The idea was to use this ability to solve various puzzles 
while progressing through the story. I also created several different art assets for it, including backgrounds and props and NPC characters for
several different locations. I created multiple 2D animations for it in photoshop that I implemented in Unity, including movement animations for the 
player character. It is essentially a playable demo, although it was stored on a computer that is no longer functional. I backed them up to another 
drive and hope to be able to make it playable again soon, although I'm currently stalled by Unity not likeing the copied files.

My younger brother aspired to make games for a while and I created all the art and animations for that as well, although he did the coding. It was never
completed but you can find videos on the Facebook page he made for it - https://www.facebook.com/thetrainhopper/

My greatest claim to fame to date is the work I did for Grand State Awareness- a tabletop roll playing game being produced by Ghostly Gaming LLC. I
created concept art for all their player character races as well as various art pieces for their player handbook, including the cover. I also worked
on a weekly webcomic for their website for a time, doing everything from story boarding to the final production myself. It is currently on hiatus, I 
belive their writer was dealing with some personal things, but you can find it on their website - https://ghostlygamingllc.com/gsa/
I believe it's really going to be something special when they're done with it.

I was recently told by a very amazing recruiter that my artistic ability and technical inclination would probably make me a great fit for being a
technical artist. I did some research and it turns out she was at least right in the fact that it ticks all my skills and interests. I'm currently
trying to learn everything I can so hopefully some day soon I can land a job with a company doing just that.
