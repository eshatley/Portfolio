Unity recently made released their training program on Unity Learn, Junior Programmer, designed to get you ready to take the Unity Certification 
test and get a job as a game developer. I decided to take this course and upload the code I create during it. So far it has not covered anything 
I haven't already taught myself, but I like the way the course is structured and the teacher is very good. I'm hoping to pick up some new skills 
or perhaps new and better ways of doing things I already know.
