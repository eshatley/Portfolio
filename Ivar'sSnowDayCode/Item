//We're going to be creating a simple inventory system for my 2D adventure game Ivar's Snow Day

//First we'll create an Item class
public class Item
{   
    //We'll make everything public so we can access it in the inspector window
    public int id; //We want to assign each item a unique id number. There won't be many items so this shouldn't be too hard
    public string name; //We'll want this name to be the same as the name of our game object for the item
    public string description; //May or may not want to give each item a description. I haven't decided yet so we'll include it
    public Sprite icon; //And of course it wouldn't be an inventory screen if each item didn't have a unique icon to represent it in the menu
    
    /*If we wanted each item to have stats we would probably store those in a dictionary, but I don't think there will be 
    anything in this paticular adventure game that requires stats. Mostly the items you pick up will be for aesthetic and
    story purposes. It is about a child after all and they certainly do love to stick things in their pockets! I do however
    reserve the right to change my mind later. There's going to be atleast one sequence that plays out like a turn based 
    battle, but that is mostly for comedic effect and I don't see a complex stat system being required at this time.*/
    
    //Now every class needs a constructor so here we go
    public Item(int id, string name, string description, Sprite icon)
    {
        //Now we asign all the arguments to their respective values
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        /*The icon is going to be a little different. One, we have to access the folder that contains it. Two, 
        we have to tell the program that the file we're grabbing is a sprite. So this will change depending on where 
        we decide to store the sprite files. Right now I have my sprites seperated by level, but this would make things...
        complicated. So I will instead decide that every item I create that is going to be able to be picked up and stored 
        inventory will have an icon stored in a predetermined folder. For simplicity we'll say this directory will be in 
        Assets/Inventory/Icons*/
        this.icon = Assets.Load<Sprite>("Inventory/Icons" + name);
        //If I add stats later I will include those here
    }
